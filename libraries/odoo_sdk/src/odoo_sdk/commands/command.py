class Command(ABC):
    """Base interface for all Odoo SDK Commands.

    A command is an atomic, composable unit of business logic with a single
    ``execute`` entry point. Commands never reference interaction surfaces (MCP,
    CLI) and never reference each other; shared logic lives in ``utilities``.

    Commands receive three peer dependencies, injected by the :class:`Registry`:

    * ``client`` — any :class:`RpcClient` (the :class:`OdooClient` in
      production; a structural fake in tests).
    * ``state`` — the :class:`LocalStateClient` (SQLite session FSM).
    * ``config`` — the :class:`LocalConfig` (resolved SDK settings).

    The client is required; the :class:`Registry` always injects it. The state
    and config dependencies are created lazily on first access so that
    lightweight commands (and unit tests) that only need the client are not
    forced to construct SQLite state or read a config file.
